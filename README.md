# DSA-Visualizer

We have developed a web application for learners to visually understand the working of different DSA with applications such as working animation, user inputs, code synchronization, step by step working of each line of code of the DSA and informative data representation of respective algorithms.
The application is developed with the idea of simplicity and ease of use for the user with enhanced experience and efficiency in understanding of the Data Structures and Algorithms.
